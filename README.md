Boone_County_Jail_Scraper
=========================
This is my first web scrapper, written as part of a three-day class I took at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.

Basically, this is a Python script that navigates to the Boone County Sheriff's Department website, to the current inmates page, iterates over all the cells of the results table and adds the contents to a .csv file.

In order to run this yourself, be sure you have BeautifulSoup(http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ "BeautifulSoup") installed.
